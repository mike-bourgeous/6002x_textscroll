About this script
-----------------
This userscript and test page allow students enrolled in the MITx course 6.002x,
Circuits and Electronics, during Spring 2012, to scroll through the full length
of the textbook.

The script makes sure that at most four page images are present from the textbook
at any given time, reducing network traffic and browser memory usage.
